#  the unfortunately titlted "frilling"

I haven't thought of a better name, or a name at all.

## What i should do next

1. Add UUID() to all models
2. Figure out why the dollarsign systemimage isn't working in Expense / Expenseview calls (so I guess techincally within content view?)
3. Figure out how groups should work
    - there's gonna be some reading here, i'm really not sure how this should work.
