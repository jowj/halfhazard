# halfhazard
## on names
i suck at names. halfhazard is an inside joke with me and Laura because I thought haphazard was pronounced with a 'fff' sound, since p and h together often do!

Also its funny to think of your finances as haphazard.

## to do
1. Make a User() a required object on an expense
    - this means i need to figure out how to instantiate a user, i guess?
2. Fix account management .sheet initial size
3. Change all .sheet view modifications to Papa's, better, view size settings
4. Start using `query` more - that's the right way to reference anything in the db
    - i think current user can and maybe even should be in appstorage, but everything else we should be persisting to db
5. Specifically, use a `Query` to make it so the only expenses you see by default have your name on them
6. Create "Manage Groups View" and an add group button
