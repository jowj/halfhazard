#  the unfortunately titlted "frilling"

I haven't thought of a better name, or a name at all.

## What i should do next

1. Add UUID() to all models
2. Figure out why the dollarsign systemimage isn't working in Expense / Expenseview calls (so I guess techincally within content view?)
3. Figure out how groups should work
    - there's gonna be some reading here, i'm really not sure how this should work.
4. Figure out how storage works
5. figure out how users work?
6. how to edit an existing entry
7. Add timestamp to expense object
8. Consider the use of "final" classes for my atomic models. Perf gains, but i'm not really sure about all the trade offs there?
9. Figure out a way to delete an item
10. Add date created to view of expenses in main view


## stuff i like and should consider including
- `RadialGradient(colors: [.blue, .black], center: .center, startRadius: 20, endRadius: 200)`
