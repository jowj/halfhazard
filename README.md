# halfhazard
## on names
i suck at names. halfhazard is an inside joke with me and Laura because I thought haphazard was pronounced with a 'fff' sound, since p and h together often do!

Also its funny to think of your finances as haphazard.

## to do
1. [ ] Make a User() a required object on an expense
    - this means i need to figure out how to instantiate a user, i guess?
    - is this even possible, or do I just, imply this somehow?
2. [X] Fix account management .sheet initial size
3. [X] Change all .sheet view modifications to Papa's, better, view size settings
4. [X] Start using `query` more - that's the right way to reference anything in the db
    - i think current user can and maybe even should be in appstorage, but everything else we should be persisting to db
5. [X] Specifically, use a `Query` to make it so the only expenses you see by default have your name on them
6. [X] Create "Manage Groups View" and an add group button
    - also add a thing to show the group per expense, maybe?
    - maybe just make groups a required thing?
..
..
??. [X] Computed property on expense that auto splits based on group memberhsip count
..

??. [X] move every swiftdata thing to cloudkit
??. [ ] add fields to configure username in login screen
    - use that instead of userID in ExpenseView
??. [ ] move all buttons to a ctrl click menu to clean up UI
??. [ ] Add a navigation menu for each  group?
- [ ] fix some of the UI in iOS
    - [ ] Certain user input bars have a gray box over them, which don't allow users to add input
    - [ ] The UI in general is Too Large, and should be shrunk a bit.
    - [ ] I should use a different input mechanism than labelled buttons on IOS. Maybe swipe to reveal?
