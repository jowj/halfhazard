#  the unfortunately titlted "frilling"

I haven't thought of a better name, or a name at all.

## What i should do next

3. Figure out how groups should work
    - there's gonna be some reading here, i'm really not sure how this should work.
5. figure out how users work?
8. Consider the use of "final" classes for my atomic models. Perf gains, but i'm not really sure about all the trade offs there?
10. Add date created to view of expenses in main view
11. how to bind keys better?
    - apple N should make new expense
    - apple F should focus search
12. Sorting is worth implementing, but I don't care about it right now: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2OEZ-R-3Zs

## stuff i like and should consider including
- `RadialGradient(colors: [.blue, .black], center: .center, startRadius: 20, endRadius: 200)`
